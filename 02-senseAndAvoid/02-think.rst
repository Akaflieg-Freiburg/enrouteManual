.. note:: Most traffic data receivers can only handle one concurrent connection.
    If more devices connect, this might lead to frequent loss of connection or
    loss of data.  To be on the safe side, it might be useful to ask your
    passengers to disable Wi-Fi on their phone before boarding.

.. note:: For best results, use FLARM compatible devices.  If your traffic
    receiver supports FLARM/NMEA as well as GDL90 output, always use FLARM/NMEA.
    The GDL90 protocol has a number of shortcomings that **Enroute Flight
    Navigation** cannot always work around.  See the Section
    :ref:`gdl90problems` for more details.

Flight Planning Tools
=====================

**Enroute Flight Navigation** comes with a set of general-purpose base maps in
vector format, which have been carefully optimized for memory consumption and
display speed.  Still, there might be situations where a user might prefer
different maps: If you fly a rescue helicopter, you might prefer high-detail
vector maps for your particular region.


FL95.de
-------

FL95.de is a free online flight planning website that is popular in Germany and
surrounding countries.  It is able to export flight routes in GPX format, which
can be read by **Enroute Flight Navigation**.  

Since FL95.de not designed for the small screens of mobile devices, we recommend
using it on a desktop or laptop computer.  Proceed as follows.

- On a desktop or laptop computer, open the website FL95.de in your web browser.
- Plan a flight.
- Once done, open the tab "Laden Speichern Drucken"
- At "GPS-Export", choose "Dateiformat: GPX" and click on "Datei erzeugen". 
- FL95.de will generate a file (typically called "FL95_EDTF_nach_EDTF.gpx") that
  will be downloaded via your web browser.  Most browsers store the file in the
  "Download" folder of your home directory.



- Transfer the file to your mobile device.

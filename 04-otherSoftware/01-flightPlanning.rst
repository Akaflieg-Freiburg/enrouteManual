Flight Planning Tools
=====================

While **Enroute Flight Navigation** offers essential flight planning
functionality, longer flights are best planned with full-featured software on a
big-screen computer.  The following software is compatible, tested, and known to
work well with **Enroute Flight Navigation**.



FL95.de
-------

`FL95.de <fl95.de>`_ is a free online flight planning website popular in Germany
and surrounding countries.  It is able to export flight routes in GPX format,
which can be read by **Enroute Flight Navigation**.  

Since `FL95.de <fl95.de>`_ is not designed for the small screens of mobile
devices, we recommend using it on a desktop or laptop computer.  Proceed as
follows.

- On a desktop or laptop computer, open the website `FL95.de <fl95.de>`_ in your
  web browser.

- Use the website to plan a flight.

- Once done, open the tab "Laden Speichern Drucken"

- At "GPS-Export", choose "Dateiformat: GPX" and click on "Datei erzeugen". 

- `FL95.de <fl95.de>`_ will generate a file (typically called
  "FL95_EDTF_nach_EDTF.gpx") that will be downloaded via your web browser.  Most
  browsers store the file in the "Download" folder of your home directory.

- The next step depends on the operating system of the device that runs
  **Enroute Flight Navigation**.

  - On Android or iOS, transfer the GPX file to your device and open the file on
    your device. The Section :ref:`importData` explains the process in detail.

  - On Linux/Desktop, transfer the GPX file to your device and use the file
    manager to drag-and-drop it into the window of **Enroute Flight
    Navigation**.

- A dialog window will open. **Enroute Flight Navigation** needs to know if the
  GPX file contains a flight route or a list of waypoints that you wish to
  import into the waypoint library.  Chose the "Route".

The `manual of FL95.de <https://fl95.de/help/help.php?p=io>`_ contains more
detailed information.

Flarmnet Data
=============

**Enroute Flight Navigation** is able to use the database from `Flarmnet.org
<https://www.flarmnet.org/flarmnet/>`_ to identify aircraft and to show the
aircraft registration in the moving map display.  The process does not require
user interaction: once the app connects to a FLARM device and receives traffic
information, the Flarmnet database will automatically be downloaded and updated
with every map update.  If desired, the database can also be downloaded manually
on the page "Maps and Data" (open the main menu and go to "Library/Maps and
Data").
